<h1>Step 2 - Power Supply</h1>
<p>The first component to make its way into the case should be the power supply, or PSU as itâ€™s more often called. Typically located at the rear of the case, usually in the bottom or top corner, the slot is easily located by searching for a square opening. This opening will have screw holes on at least two corners, and the PSU sits in it with a switch and female socket facing outward. Consult your cases is manual if you have trouble finding the proper location.</p>
